Any NDI files included here that are owned by NewTek have their own license and are not covered by any license offered by Steve Seguin. 

This folder contains NDI files, along with some files that I was using to build executable versions of the Python script with. Please note the licenses may vary between files, as not all files are going to be MIT licensed,etc.
